Welcome to the Web Developer Bootcamp, the <strong>only course you need to learn web development. </strong>There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:</p><ul><li><p>This is the only online course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor.</p></li><li><p><strong>94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs</strong>. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.</p></li><li><p>The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost <strong>$14,000 and $21,000</strong>.  This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.</p></li><li><p>Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to today's developer industry.<strong> No PHP or other dated technologies. This course does not cut any corners.</strong></p></li><li><p>This is the only complete beginner full-stack developer course that covers NodeJS.</p></li><li><p>We build 13+ projects, including a <strong>gigantic production application </strong>called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.</p></li><li><p>The course is <strong>constantly updated</strong> with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.</p></li><li><p>You get to meet my dog Rusty!</p></li></ul><p>When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the \"beginner friendly\" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.</p><p>Throughout the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 4</strong></p></li><li><p>SemanticUI</p></li><li><p>DOM Manipulation</p></li><li><p><strong>jQuery</strong></p></li><li><p>Unix(Command Line) Commands</p></li><li><p><strong>NodeJS</strong></p></li><li><p>NPM</p></li><li><p><strong>ExpressJS</strong></p></li><li><p>REST</p></li><li><p><strong>MongoDB</strong></p></li><li><p>Database Associations</p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p></li><li><p>PassportJS</p></li><li><p>Authorization</p></li></ul><p>This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of \"watch as I code\" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:<br></p><ul><li><p>Lectures</p></li><li><p>Code-Alongs</p></li><li><p>Projects</p></li><li><p>Exercises</p></li><li><p>Research Assignments</p></li><li><p>Slides</p></li><li><p>Downloads</p></li><li><p>Readings</p></li><li><p>Too many pictures of my dog Rusty</p></li></ul><p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.  I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.  Sign up today and see how fun, exciting, and rewarding web development can be!</p>",

You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse</em></p><p><em>The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!<br></em></p><p><em>As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.</em></p><p><strong>This Course uses TypeScript</strong></p><p>TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular&nbsp;team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular&nbsp;apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular&nbsp;apps. Check out the free videos for more information.</p><p>TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.</p><p><strong>Why Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular&nbsp;is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular&nbsp;allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.</p><p>Angular 9&nbsp;simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.</p><p>Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.</p><p>Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular&nbsp;(=Angular 9)&nbsp;you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.</p><p><strong>Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular&nbsp;applications</strong></p><p>This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a lot of deep dives and each section is backed up with a real project. All examples showcase the features Angular&nbsp;offers and how to apply them correctly.</p><p>Specifically you will learn:</p><ul><li><p>Which architecture Angular&nbsp;uses</p></li><li><p>How to use TypeScript to write Angular&nbsp;applications</p></li><li><p>All about directives and components, including the creation of custom directives/ components</p></li><li><p>How databinding works</p></li><li><p>All about routing and handling navigation</p></li><li><p>What Pipes are and how to use them</p></li><li><p>How to access the Web (e.g. RESTful servers)</p></li><li><p>What dependency injection is and how to use it</p></li><li><p>How to use Modules in Angular</p></li><li><p>How to optimize your (bigger) Angular&nbsp;Application</p></li><li><p>An introduction to NgRx and complex state management</p></li><li><p>We will build a major project in this course so that you can practice all concepts</p></li><li><p>and so much more!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pay once, benefit a lifetime!</strong></p><p>Don’t lose any time, gain an edge and start developing now!</p>",

        "description": "<p>You’ve just stumbled upon the most complete, in-depth <strong>Java programming course online</strong>. With over 260,000 students enrolled and <strong>tens of thousands of 5 star reviews</strong> to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need. </p><p>Whether you want to:</p><p>- build the skills you need to get your first Java programming job</p><p>- move to a more senior software developer position</p><p>- pass the oracle java certification exam</p><p>- or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps quickly.<br></p><p>...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this, <em>and more.</em> </p><p><br><strong>Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want</strong> and which course will give you those skills?<br><br>This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.  By the end of the course you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer. <br><br>Lots of students have been success with getting their first job or a promotion after going through the course.<br><br>Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.  She didn't even complete the course!</p><p><br><strong>\"</strong>Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.   I decided to switch career path and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a life line. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.  Yesterday, three months after starting the course and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life changing. <strong> With gratitude,  Laura\"</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 76 hours long.  <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.   Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly, the course is designed as a one stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).  The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.  JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.  So you could skip that section entirely.  But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.   And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>Why would you choose to learn Java?</strong></p><p>The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.  It's in the hundreds.  Why would you choose the Java language?</p><p>The number one reason is its popularity.  According to many official websites that track popularity of languages, Java is either #1 or in the top 3.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use.  Java came out in the 1990's and is still very popular today.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but thats not necessarily the case with Java.</p><p>Until recently Java releases were infrequent (one major release in 3 years was common).  Companies standardised on specific versions of Java.  Right now most companies are still focused on Java 8, which is a relatively old version, dating back to 2015.</p><p>Oracle (the owners of Java) are now releasing new versions of Java every six months, and when the new version comes out the old version is no longer supported.</p><p>But to cater for most companies who tend to stick to specific versions of Java for a long time, they have marked the current version of Java - Java 11 as LTS - or Long Term support. That means that they guarantee to support this version for the long term - for a number of years at least.</p><p>Companies will stick to versions of Java that are supported in the long term. For career purposes you should learn the appropriate versions of Java that your future employer will likely be using.  Right now thats Java 8 and Java 11 (Java 9 and Java 10 have been released and already been marked obsolete and are no longer supported).<br><br>The good news is that this course is focused on Java 8, and has recently been updated for Java 11.  <br><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  Core Java is the fundamental parts of the java jdk (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best seller since it's release on Udemy, you would be joining over 260,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are close to 60,000 reviews left by students.  It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics and all-round confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program.  You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE (Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.  That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works. </p><p>As your instructor, I have over <strong>35 years experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 18 years <em>(I’ve taught students younger than that)</em>. Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!</p><p>It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...</p><p><strong>See what your fellow students have to say:</strong></p><p>\"This course was a guiding light in my \"Becoming a developer\" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to \"Tim Buchalka\" my Master.\" - Sina Jz<br><br>\"I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes. I wrote a code and showed it to a programmer, and he was shocked, he told me that I'm more than ready to start a programming career.\" - Amirreza Moeini<br><br>\"I am taking this class in conjunction with a Java 101 college class. I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said \"go make a program that does *whatever*\" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked.\" - Stacy Harris<br></p><p>It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results, <em>and you can be too</em>…</p><p>This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects, <br><br><strong>Is the course updated?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br><br>A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning an older version of Java can be counter productive - you could will be learning the \"old way\" of doing things, rather than using current technology.<br><br>Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.  <br><br>That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong>. Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak). <br><br>I've continued to do this since the original version of the course came out, and recently have been updating it to Java 11.<br><br>With this complete Java Masterclass, you will always have updated, relevant content.</p><p><strong><em>What if I have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With my hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p>That’s just one reason why I was voted <strong>top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards</strong> (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  </p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>This course is a great place to ask questions if you have them or find help if you become stuck in areas.<em>” - Blake S.</em></p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let me know and I’ll refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Java skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enrol now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Java brilliance. Or, take this course for a free spin using the preview feature, so you know you’re 100% certain this course is for you. </p><p><strong>See you on the inside <em>(hurry, Java class is waiting!)</em></strong></p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>This course is fully up-to-date with the latest version of React and includes React Hooks! Of course it will be kept up-to-date in the future&nbsp;:-)</strong></p><p>---</p><p><strong>What's this course about?</strong></p><p>Learn React or dive deeper into it.&nbsp;Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course:&nbsp;The Burger Builder!</p><p><strong>More details please!</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the <strong>major driver</strong> of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.</p><p>But using JavaScript <strong>can be challenging</strong> - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.</p><p><strong>React to the rescue!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>React is all about components</strong> - basically custom HTML&nbsp;elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.</p><p>Need to display a list of users in your app?&nbsp;It's as simple as creating a \"User\"&nbsp;component and outputting it as often as needed.</p><p>This course will <strong>start at the very basics</strong> and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way <strong>from basic to advanced</strong>. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page)&nbsp;applications!</p><p>A detailed list with the course content can be found below.</p><p><strong>Who's teaching you in this course?</strong></p><p>My name is Maximilian Schwarzmüller, I'm a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I'm also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I&nbsp;cover React's most popular alternatives - Vue and Angular - as well as many other topics. I know what I'm talking about and I&nbsp;know where the pain points can be found.</p><p>It's my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don't just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that's why we'll dive deeply into React and why I&nbsp;made sure to also share knowledge that's helpful to&nbsp;advanced React developers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>This course is for you if ...</p><ul><li><p>...you're just getting started with frontend/&nbsp;JavaScript development and only got the JS&nbsp;basics set (no prior React or other framework experience is required!)</p></li><li><p>...you're experienced with Angular or Vue but want to dive into React</p></li><li><p>...know the React basics but want to refresh them and/ or dive deeper</p></li><li><p>...already worked quite a bit with React but want to dive deeper and see it all come together in a bigger app</p></li></ul><p><strong>What should you bring to succeed in that course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>HTML + CSS&nbsp;+ JavaScript knowledge is required. You don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set</p></li><li><p>NO&nbsp;advanced JavaScript knowledge is required, though you'll be able to move even quicker through the course if you know next-gen JavaScript features like ES6 Arrow functions.<strong> A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course though.</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>What's inside the course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The \"What\", \"Why\"&nbsp;and \"How\"</p></li><li><p>React Basics (Base features, syntax and concepts)</p></li><li><p>Managing state with class-based components and React Hooks</p></li><li><p>How to output lists and conditional content</p></li><li><p>Styling of React components</p></li><li><p>A deep dive into the internals of React and advanced component features</p></li><li><p>How to access Http content from within React apps (AJAX)</p></li><li><p>Redux,&nbsp;Redux, Redux ... from basics to advanced!</p></li><li><p>Forms and form validation in React apps</p></li><li><p>Authentication</p></li><li><p>An introduction to unit testing</p></li><li><p>An introduction to Next.js</p></li><li><p>React app deployment instructions</p></li><li><p>...and much more!</p></li></ul>",
